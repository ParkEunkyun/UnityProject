Open up Example.unity to test out all of this asset's features.

To implement inventory features into your own game, drag the relevant prefabs into a scene.
I recommend Inventory Canvas and Cheat Menu (prefabs/UI/...) to get started and see how the basics work.
Press Tab to open Inventory, press C to open the cheat menu.

If you're using your own Player prefab, just make sure it's tagged as "Player" to get the crafting tables working.
Check out the local documentation for more info/guides.
